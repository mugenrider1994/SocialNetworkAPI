# Social Network API

This is an API for a social network web application that allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.

## User Story

As a social media startup, we want an API for our social network that uses a NoSQL database, so our website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The server is started, and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
- API GET routes for users and thoughts return data in a formatted JSON.
- API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts are successfully tested in Insomnia.
- API POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts and adding/removing friends to a userâ€™s friend list are successfully tested in Insomnia.

## Installation

To run the Social Network API, you need the following technologies:

- Node.js
- Express.js
